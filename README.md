# Psychology Coding Club - University of Southampton

On this page is a collection of code snippets, challenges, and other information gathered by the Psychology Coding Club. We work together to learn new ways to improve and enhance our coding skills, help people out, and give ourselves new and interesting challenges.

## Coding Club Challenges

### Challenge #1: The Broadbent Challenge

In the first challenge, Philippa challenged us with the following:

>The goal is the have a button on every page of the experiment which, when clicked, redirects the participant to the debrief page and deletes their data (like the addAbortButton jatos function that doesn't seem to work when the jsPsych experiment is exported to external jatos).  A bonus challenge is to left-align the text in the consent and debrief forms but keep the text in the main experiment centre-aligned.

We did what we could.

### Challenge #2: :potato: The Rotato Challenge

The challenge:
To create a simple rotating 3D object that can be somehow adjusted by the participant (e.g. moving the mouse would change the size or shape of it) and display this during a trial alongside a static image stimulus, ideally in jsPsych. For example, the previous version of the experiment (written in Matlab) had two surfaces in the shape of an open book which could be adjusted by the participants (making the book more or less open). This was presented next to a circular image stimulus of a natural scene.
