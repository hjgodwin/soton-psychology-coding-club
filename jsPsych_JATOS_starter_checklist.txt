jsPsych and JATOS starter checklist
1.	To download jsPsych (a library of plugins for javascript) and visual studio code (a code editor– like Word but for code) follow these instructions: https://www.jspsych.org/tutorials/hello-world/. This is also gives a step by step tutorial for creating something really basic in jsPsych.
2.	You can view your experiment in the browser by downloading an extension in VS code. Open a file in VS code then click the extension button on the left (four squares) and search for ‘open in browser’ then install that extension.  Then when you right click on your file’s tab at the top of the screen (e.g. experiment.html) there will be the option to ‘Open in Default Browser’.   Click this to view your experiment in the browser. 
3.	You could now try following a more complex jsPsych demo which gives you step by step instructions for programming a response time task: https://www.jspsych.org/tutorials/rt-task/ 
4.	You can also view your experiment in the browser using JATOS (just another tool for online software), this is a server that you can use to host the experiment online.  There are two elements of JATOS, there’s local JATOS (a local installation of JATOS) where you can view the experiment in the browser only on your computer.  There’s also external JATOS which is where you can share your experiment online for others to complete on their computers.
a.	To download local JATOS follow the step by step instructions here: https://www.jatos.org/Installation.html 
b.	To get an account on the external JATOS server for Southampton Psychology email Jin (J.W.Zhang@soton.ac.uk) or Anthony (apw1@soton.ac.uk) and ask them to make you an account.  When you’ve got an account you’ll be asked to reset your password and then you can login at https://studies.psychology.soton.ac.uk/jatos/login 
5.	You need to add a few bits of code to get your jsPsych code to work with JATOS, there’s a nice step by step guide here: https://www.jatos.org/jsPsych-and-JATOS.html
